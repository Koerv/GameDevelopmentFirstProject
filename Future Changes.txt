By priority:
- Fix pathfinding to work even on downwards/upwards intersections
- add hp bars
- apply poison all 3 tiles instead of 4
- It would make more sense if bosses have more strength/less aspd, currently it is the other way around
- add error handling (bosses can't be places there etc)
- Add different Map types
- add Title Screen/Main Menu
- improve look of Buttons, Gui
- add audios
- make gui elements anchor at corners instead of moving dependent on screen size
- Undo adding a boss while he is selected
- improve visual information for hero, boss etc (popups, icons instead of text)
- paths open at certain stage(s)
__________________________________________________________________________________________until CVTag
- Add achievements
- Find new names for RPS (or leave it be)
- Add playable Tutorial
- Use own Sprites
- add intro
- add Avatar (=dungeon master), look changeable through ingame purchase, makes comments about pesky heroes etc
- new hero/boss skins, buyable through in game purchase
- new hero type: fast and furious? (always goes down/up if possible)
- make game android-friendly

Test if this makes the game better:
- Healing bosses
- Adding potions every level?
- changing number of stages?
- Change Boss/hero stats to depend on a base level
- Player gets info about where the hero walks beforehand and can see if its protected enough
- When hero reaches princess: Enter "Emergency mode" where player can place bosses as the hero leaves the dungeon
- maybe have a special hero/special conditions at entering last stage?
